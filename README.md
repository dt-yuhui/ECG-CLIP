# ECG-CLIP

Welcome to the ECG-CLIP repository! This repository is part of the ECG-CLIP project, which aims to enhance ECG analysis using the CLIP framework.

## About the Project

**ECG-CLIP** is a comprehensive project that includes two main phases:

1. **Pretraining Phase**: Utilizing the CLIP framework for training a foundation model on ECG signal-text paired data.
2. **Downstream Task Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the pretrained models for various tasks, including:
   - **ECG Disease Diagnosis**
   - **Echocardiogram Disease Diagnosis**
   - **Prognosis Analysis** (currently released)

At this stage, only the **prognosis analysis** code is released. This code aims to predict patient outcomes based on ECG data, and it forms a critical part of the downstream fine-tuning tasks. The full ECG-CLIP codebase, including pretraining and other downstream tasks, will be released at a later time.

## Features

- **Prognosis Analysis**: Models and tools for analyzing ECG data to predict prognosis.
- **Modular Codebase**: Code is organized to facilitate future expansions, including pretraining and additional downstream tasks.
- **Documentation**: Basic usage instructions to get started with prognosis analysis code.

## Future Releases

The complete ECG-CLIP repository, including pretraining code and other downstream tasks (such as ECG and echocardiogram disease diagnosis), will be released in the future. Please stay tuned for updates!

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions related to **Prognosis Analysis**, please refer to the [README of the VHD-Survival directory](https://github.com/dt-yuhui/ECG-CLIP/blob/main/VHD-Survival/README.md). This includes all the steps, commands, and configuration options required to run the prognosis analysis code.
